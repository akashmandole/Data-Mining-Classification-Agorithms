# Data-Mining-Classification-Agorithms

Implementation of three classification algorithms: Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, and Na√Øve Bayes.

10-fold Cross Validation to evaluate the performance of all methods on the datasets in terms of Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F-1 measure.

note* - Data format : Each line represents one data sample. The last column of each line is class label, either 0 or 1. The rest columns are feature values, each of them can be a real-value (continuous type) or a string (nominal type).
